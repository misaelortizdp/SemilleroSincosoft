### Figma Link : https://www.figma.com/file/FsMxn81NnMU4FbiEj4daln/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

This time around I feel like making the figma is a lot easier and faster now also having a clear idea of what each part of my design will be in code is possible now

I look back at my old design and i always see errors in css code and in the way I wrote the code. 


### HTML page

mnaking functionality completely from css is actually niot as bhard as i thought, you can place hover effects on elements and make other elements appear. It's so simple yet very cool i think i will not use javascript for simple task like this one anymore
